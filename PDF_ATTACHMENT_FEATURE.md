# PDF Attachment Feature for Quotations

## Overview
The Custom Mailer Service now supports PDF attachments for quotation emails. When you upload a file for data extraction, you can also include that file as an attachment in the quotation email.

## How It Works

### 1. File Upload & Data Extraction
- Upload a PDF, Word document, or image file to the quotation form
- The system extracts quotation data automatically and populates form fields
- The uploaded file is stored temporarily for potential attachment

### 2. Attachment Option
- After successful file upload, a checkbox appears: "ðŸ“Ž Include uploaded file as attachment"
- Users can choose whether to attach the original file to the email
- The checkbox is only visible when a file has been uploaded

### 3. Email Sending
- **With Attachment**: Uses `/api/send-email-with-attachment` endpoint with FormData
- **Without Attachment**: Uses standard `/api/send-email` endpoint with JSON
- Button text changes to indicate attachment: "Send Quotation with Attachment"

## Technical Implementation

### Components Updated
1. **FileUpload.tsx**
   - Modified to pass both extracted data AND the original file
   - Updated interface: `onFileProcessed: (data: any, file?: File) => void`

2. **QuotationForm.tsx**
   - Added state for storing uploaded file: `const [uploadedFile, setUploadedFile] = useState<File | null>(null)`
   - Modified `handleFileProcessed` to store file and auto-check attachment option
   - Updated email sending logic to handle both scenarios (with/without attachment)
   - Added attachment checkbox with file name display

3. **New API Route: /api/send-email-with-attachment/route.ts**
   - Handles FormData with file attachment
   - Converts file to base64 for Resend API
   - Includes BCC functionality
   - Uses proper contentType for attachments

### Code Flow
```
1. User uploads file â†’ FileUpload component
2. Data extracted â†’ handleFileProcessed called with data + file
3. File stored in state â†’ uploadedFile state updated
4. Checkbox appears â†’ User can choose to include attachment
5. Form submitted â†’ Different API endpoint based on attachment choice
6. Email sent â†’ With or without attachment as selected
```

## User Experience

### Visual Indicators
- **File uploaded**: Success message with extracted data confirmation

### File Support

- **Word documents**: `.doc`, `.docx`
- **Images**: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`
- **Size limit**: 10MB maximum

## Benefits

1. **Streamlined Workflow**: Extract data AND attach source document in one step
2. **Professional Communication**: Include original proposals/quotes with email
3. **Client Convenience**: Recipients get both formatted email and source document
4. **Flexibility**: Optional attachment - users choose when to include files
5. **Compliance**: Maintain document trails for business records

## Security & Performance

- Files are processed temporarily and not permanently stored
- Base64 encoding for secure transmission via Resend API
- File size validation prevents oversized attachments
- BCC functionality maintained for all emails with attachments

## Example Usage

1. **Upload a PDF quotation**: System extracts client info, amounts, etc.
2. **Review extracted data**: Edit any fields as needed
3. **Check attachment box**: "ðŸ“Ž Include uploaded file as attachment"
4. **Send quotation**: Client receives both formatted email AND original PDF

This feature bridges the gap between automated data extraction and professional document sharing, making the quotation process more efficient and comprehensive.
